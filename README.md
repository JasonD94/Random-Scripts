Random bash scripts I've written and/or modified.

Couple of notes:
- I put any requirements I know at the top of the script. This may include "beep" for making the PC
speaker beep. It might also include other random stuff found on the ubuntu repos.
- I run Xubuntu 14.04 LTS, so these should work on other Ubuntu/Debian based distros.

1. rsync backup - this one will backup my LG G3. It even beeps to let me know its done! :o
2. beep music - I found a bunch of these and wanted to save them for use later.
3. ?
