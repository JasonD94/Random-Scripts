Bash Scripts
==================================================
A bunch of random scripts I have either written or modified.

Couple of notes:
- I put any requirements I know at the top of the script. This may include "beep" for making the PC
speaker beep. It might also include other random stuff found on the ubuntu repos.
- I run Xubuntu 14.04 LTS, so these should work on other Ubuntu/Debian based distros.

1. Beep music - I found a bunch of these and wanted to save them for use later.
2. Install related scripts - mass installs ~30 programs I use.
3. A script to fix my mouse's DPI. Two lines but it should make life easier.
4. Rsync scripts - backups various hard drives to different locations/other drives. There's even one to backup my LG G3.
5. Other misc. stuff, saved for later use/modification.

To do:

1. Make more settings scripts
2. Automate everything
3. Figure out a solution to Google Drive on Linux (GOOGLE...!!)
4. Make awesome conky configs & modify cool ones to work with laptop/desktop
5. Improve rsync commands
