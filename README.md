Random bash scripts I've written and/or modified.

Couple of notes:
- I put any requirements I know at the top of the script. This may include "beep" for making the PC
speaker beep. It might also include other random stuff found on the ubuntu repos.
- I run Xubuntu 14.04 LTS, so these should work on other Ubuntu/Debian based distros.

1. beep music - I found a bunch of these and wanted to save them for use later.
2. install related scripts - mass installs ~30 programs I use.
3. A sync to fix my mouse's DPI. Two line script but it should make life easier.

I now have multiple rysnc scripts:

1. Backup my LG G3. It even beeps to let me know its done! :o (Version 1.5 is working! I wanted to autorun the script whenever I plug my G3 in to charge, but MTP wouldn't automount. The most I can do is make a script to yell at me to mount the G3 and run the backup script. :|)

2. Backup to my NAS, aka my old netbook with FREENAS booted off an SD card. Pretty much mirrors my /home directory to a directory on that drive in another room.

3. Sync my Linux machines. This one will copy stuff from my desktop to my laptop and then from my laptop to my desktop WITHOUT deleting stuff.

4. NEED TO DO a sync for my 4 hard drives in my desktop.
