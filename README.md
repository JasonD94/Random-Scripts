Random bash scripts I've written and/or modified.

Couple of notes:
- I put any requirements I know at the top of the script. This may include "beep" for making the PC
speaker beep. It might also include other random stuff found on the ubuntu repos.
- I run Xubuntu 14.04 LTS, so these should work on other Ubuntu/Debian based distros.

1. rsync backup - this one will backup my LG G3. It even beeps to let me know its done! :o (Version 1.3 is working! I wanted to autorun the script whenever I plug my G3 in to charge, but MTP wouldn't automount. The most I can do is make a script to yell at me to mount the G3 and run the backup script. :|)
2. beep music - I found a bunch of these and wanted to save them for use later.
3. install related scripts - mass installs ~30 programs I use.
4. A sync to fix my mouse's DPI. Two line script but it should make life easier.
