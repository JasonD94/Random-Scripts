Macros
======

Just a bunch of random macros I made to annoy friends. 

Uses xmacroplay and xmacrorec.

To record a Macro, I found just doing:

xmacrorec2 > TEXT FILE.txt

was enough. Use "ESC" to end the Macro.

To play back a macro, use:

xmacroplay "$DISPLAY" < TEXT FILE.txt

From what I understand, "$DISPLAY" just uses whatever display you used to record the macro.

Macros can be fun and useful. Throw that play back command into a script and you can do some cool stuff, like bug your friends or automate a boring task.
